title: Recording Cars for a Crowdsource
---

Recording cars is pretty new for me. I've done some passby recordings before. The Field Recording Slack hosted the Daily Driver's Crowdsource from March to June 2023. It had the most extensive requirements for any crowdsource I've done so far, and I wanted to document and share my process. 

I wanted to decide on my location early on. I live by a busy street, so recording anything, even interior recordings, can be almost impossible. Somebody in their Dodge Charger that's missing a muffler can always sense the moment I've pressed record. Izotope RX can save the day sometimes, but it can only do so much to preserve clarity and quality.
