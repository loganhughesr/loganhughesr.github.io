I'm a Video Game SFX Artist from Michigan! Thanks for checking out my page!

Growing up, I played piano, composed, and recorded music. I also really liked playing video games, and put many hours into my Nintendo DS titles like Rhythm Heaven and Pokemon HeartGold. I went to study music and sound engineering in college, and during my second year of university, I discovered video game audio. I joined a student-run game development club called <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>, at the recommendation of a friend. I didn't know anything about sound for games then, but I loved tinkering with synthesizers and creating experimental new sounds in my music.

Once I created my first sound effects for a WolverineSoft Studio game, I realized the sound design process was extremely creative, and I thrived in it. A few projects later, I dove into audio implementation. Using tools like FMOD and Wwise with Unity, I learned that thoughtfully-implemented dynamic audio is just as important as having good sound effects!

Great game audio is critical to an immersive player experience, and it is a facet of production in the earlier phases of development when brainstorming ideas for making environments, player characters, NPCs, and more. I love exploring how sound effects influence a game's development and a player's interaction with the game.

When I've got some spare time, you might find me playing a board game, going birding, reading a book, or as of recently, watching videos on making cities more walkable (Not Just Bikes). Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter, Instagram, or shoot me an email at lhughesaudio@protonmail.com! I've recently graduated from college and am open to work!

I graduated. Mention degree? Skills? 

It wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I discovered video game audio at the student run game development club at my university called <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>. After making my first few sound effects, I was blown away by how creative I could be with the sounds I made, but I also appreciated the technical skills required for designing sfx. I have created and implemented SFX in many games with . Lately, I've been designing sounds for a short film called Mei Hou Wong. In all of these projects, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing a role in creating interactions that are more meaningful and immersive with sound. I strive to continue exploring the role of sound in interaction with video games. Feel free to reach out on Twitter, Instagram, or lhughesaudio@protonmail.com!
