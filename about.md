I'm a SFX Artist from Michigan. I've always loved sound, and I've always played video games. It wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I discovered video game audio. After making my first few sound effects, I grew a deep passion for the practice because of how creative it was. I have created and implemented SFX in many games with <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>. Lately, I've been designing sounds for a short film called Mei Hou Wong. In all of these projects, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing a role in creating interactions that are more meaningful and immersive with sound. I strive to continue exploring the role of sound in interaction with video games. Feel free to reach out on Twitter, Instagram, or lhughesaudio@protonmail.com!
