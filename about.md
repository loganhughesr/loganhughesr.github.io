**I'm a Sound Designer based in Chicago!** Thanks for checking out my page!

Growing up, I played piano and sunk lots time into many Nintendo DS games. I didn't think much of those games, even though they were perfect for letting the days drift by.

I now see that games are interactive simulations that have the ability to deliver unique stories of human experience. I use sound as a vital story-telling device to paint a whole picture. **Sharing messages through games will be a part of how we shape our understanding of the world. I strive to be a part of this conversation.**

In my spare time, I'm making electronic music, biking, birding, checking out record stores, or attempting to make it through a book.

**Feel free to reach out and send me an email at lhughesaudio@protonmail.com.** I'd be happy to chat!
