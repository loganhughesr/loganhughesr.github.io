**I'm a Video Game SFX Artist from Michigan!** Thanks for checking out my page!

<!-- Origin story is good!! can be editted down-->
Growing up, I played piano, composed, and recorded music. I also played video games and sunk many hours into Nintendo DS titles like Rhythm Heaven and Pokemon HeartGold. Thinking I would work in a recording studio, I went to study music and sound engineering in college. **During my second year of university, I discovered game audio** by joining a student-run game development club called <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>. Even though I didn't know anything about game audio or game development, I loved tinkering with synthesizers and creating weird sounds. Once I created my first sound effects for WolverineSoft Studio, **I realized that I thrived in the extremely creative nature of sound design and game development, so I decided to take it up as a career.** 

I'm always blown away by the innovation and personality of indie games. So many unique ideas and stories are brought to light because of them, and I want to contribute to those stories with sound and create those moments that make my hair stand on end or get me to empathize with the characters in-game.

During my spare time, I might be playing a board game, listening to birds, reading a book, or as of recently, watching urbanist Youtube content (Not Just Bikes).
