I'm a Video Game SFX Artist from Michigan! Thanks for checking out my page!

Growing up, I played piano and composed music. I also really liked playing video games, and put a lot of hours into my Nintendo DS games like Mario Kart and Pokemon HeartGold. I wanted to study music and sound in college, and during my second year of university, I discovered video game audio. I joined a student-run game development club called <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>, at the recommendation of a friend. I didn't know anything about sound for games then, but I loved tinkering with synthesizers and creating experimental new sounds in my music.

Once I created my first sound effects for a WolverineSoft Studio game, I realized the sound design process was extremely creative, and I thrived in it. A few projects later, I had dove into audio implementation, where I learned that effectively implemented dynamic audio is just as important as having good sound effects!

Good game audio is of course critical to an immersive player experience, but it's just as important in the earlier phases of development for contributing to the conversation when making an enemy, player character, or environment. I love exploring how SFX influence the conversation in production and between the game and the player. I want to bring that forward in the games that I work on in the future.

When I've got some spare time, you might find me playing a board game, going birding, reading a book, or as of recently, watching videos on making cities more walk-able. Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter, Instagram, or shoot me an email at lhughesaudio@protonmail.com!

It wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I discovered video game audio at the student run game development club at my university called <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>. After making my first few sound effects, I was blown away by how creative I could be with the sounds I made, but I also appreciated the technical skills required for designing sfx. I have created and implemented SFX in many games with . Lately, I've been designing sounds for a short film called Mei Hou Wong. In all of these projects, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing a role in creating interactions that are more meaningful and immersive with sound. I strive to continue exploring the role of sound in interaction with video games. Feel free to reach out on Twitter, Instagram, or lhughesaudio@protonmail.com!
