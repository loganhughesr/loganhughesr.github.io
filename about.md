**I'm a Video Game SFX Artist from Michigan!** Thanks for checking out my page!

Growing up, I played piano, composed, and recorded music. I also liked playing video games, and put many hours into Nintendo DS titles like Rhythm Heaven and Pokemon HeartGold. I went to study music and sound engineering in college thinking I would work in a recording studio, but then, **during my second year of university, I discovered game audio.** I joined a student-run game development club called <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>, at the recommendation of a friend. Even I didn't know anything about game audio or game development, I loved tinkering with synthesizers and creating experimental new sounds in my music. After I created my first sound effects for a WolverineSoft Studio game, **I realized that sound design for games is extremely creative, and I thrived in it.**

**Great game audio is critical to an immersive player experience.** It is a facet of production in the earlier phases of development when brainstorming ideas for making environments, player characters, NPCs, and more. **I love how sound effects influence game development and players' interactions with games.**

During my spare time, I might be playing a board game, listening to birds, reading a book, or as of recently, watching ubanist youtube content (Not Just Bikes). 

**Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or shoot me an email at lhughesaudio@protonmail.com.** I'd be happy to chat! I've recently graduated from college and am open to work.

I graduated. Mention degree? Skills? 

It wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I discovered video game audio at the student run game development club at my university called <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>. After making my first few sound effects, I was blown away by how creative I could be with the sounds I made, but I also appreciated the technical skills required for designing sfx. I have created and implemented SFX in many games with . Lately, I've been designing sounds for a short film called Mei Hou Wong. In all of these projects, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing a role in creating interactions that are more meaningful and immersive with sound. I strive to continue exploring the role of sound in interaction with video games. Feel free to reach out on Twitter, Instagram, or lhughesaudio@protonmail.com!
