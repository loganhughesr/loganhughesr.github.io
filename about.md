I'm a SFX Artist from Michigan. I've always loved sound and played video games, but it wasn't until my sophomore year of college that I discovered the world of video game audio. After making my first few sfx, I grew a deep appreciation for the creativity required to make them. I have worked on many games with <a href="https://wolverinesoft-studio.itch.io/">WolverineSoft Studio</a>, and have made sound for a short film called Mei Hou Wong. In all of these projects, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing a role in making interaction more meaninful and immersive with sound. I strive to continue exploring the role of sound in interaction. Thank you for checking out my portfolio. Feel free to contact me on Twitter or Instagram!
