These are notable projects of mine that don't necessarily fit on other parts of my website.
## Aulphon Logistics

I'm half of this live hardware electronic music duo (electro/dance/experimental/abstract/drone). Listen to our sounds [here.](https://www.aulphonlogistics.net) Previously known as [o0.](https://o0music.bandcamp.com)

## FifthWall

A unity package that is a dynamic camera system for musical VR performances. I made this with direction from Professor [Anil Camci](https://anilcamci.github.io/fifthwall/) from the University of Michigan with funding from [Arts Initiative](https://arts.umich.edu/arts-initiative/research/pilot-projects/bringing-down-the-fifth-wall-a-system-for-delivering-vr-performances-to-large-audiences/). The repository is currently private, but it will be released sometime soon.

## Grain Room 

A granular synthesizer instrument for VR that allows the user to create interesting sonic interactions with the affordances of virtual 3D space. 

*The first part of the video is an overview of the functionality. **Skip to 2:37** to see me playing the Instrument!*

An Arduino-based musical instrument shaped like a caterpillar! A fun interface to play a synthesizer created in Max/MSP.
